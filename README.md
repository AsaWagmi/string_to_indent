# string_to_indent
If you have a JSON string and you want to format it properly with indentation to make it more readable
In this exemple I have a JSON string with the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of a smart contract named "Levinswap"
You can do this with every smart contract, all you have to do is : 
Change this part
    # Example JSON string representing the ABI
    abi_json_string =  your ABI

And change the file directory
    # Define the file path for the new JSON file
    file_path = "C:/Users/path/to/new_file.json"
